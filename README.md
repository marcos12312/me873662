What is IP adress, and how is my webpage stored on a server?

Your probably wondering, how does a IP adress work? Well actually, IP adresses allows information to be sent between devices on any network. And a IP adress can also give information about your location too. Adding that an IP adress can also make devices accessible for communication. You may also question yourself, how is my webpage stored on servers. First things first, there are two parts of your website. One part is the set of code files, and another is the database. And the code files are stored in a folder on your computer and the data base usually runs on a seperate server.
